      perl Makefile.PL
      make

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Phalanx100;

      @dists = Module::Phalanx100->dists;
      if (Module::Phalanx100->dists('HTML-Parser')) {
        ...
      }

      @mods  = Module::Phalanx100->modules();
      $dist = Module::Phalanx100->modules('HTML::Parser');

DESCRIPTION
    This module returns a list of Phalanx 100 distributions and modules, to
    be used with other applications which need this information.

    It only provides a list of distrobutions or modules. It does not
    install them.  (Use Bundle::Phalanx100 for that purpose.)

    This information is generated by the scripts/update-list.pl script which
    cross-references the modules in Bundle::Phalanx100 with the latest
    package list from CPAN. Any omissions or errors in those lists will be
    translated to the lists returned by this module.

    Additional information can be found in the module documentation.
